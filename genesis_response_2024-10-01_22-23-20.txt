**The Story of Noah's Ark**



Noah was a righteous man who lived 600 years before God judged the earth with a flood. The Lord saw that the wickedness of humanity had spread across the earth, and He regretted creating them (Genesis 6:6-7). God told Noah to build an ark, a large boat that could save him, his family, and two of every kind of animal from the coming flood.



Noah obeyed God's command and built the ark according to His instructions. When the ark was finished, God instructed Noah to bring in his family and enter the ark himself (Genesis 7:1-3). Then, for 120 years, it rained and poured, and the floodwaters covered the entire earth.
